# hello-world
my first repository using Hello World!

Olufemi here...but my friends all call me 'Femi. I'm an avid computer geek and I love everything about computers and technology. I try to be abreast of new developments in the tech industry and it is my dream to be part of something truly big and life-changing; you can say I really want to make a difference. Besides, all this I love sports and football (or as the Americans call it - SOCCER) ranks as my numero uno. I am an avid AC Milan fan and support the Super Eagles of Nigeria - the Nigerian Men's National Footbal Team.
